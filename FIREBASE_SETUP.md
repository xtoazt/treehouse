## üîí Step 7: Configure Security Rules

### Firestore Rules

1. **Navigate to Firestore Rules**
   - Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules tab
   - Replace the default rules with these secure rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own user document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Family tree access control
    match /familyTrees/{treeId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid || 
         request.auth.uid in resource.data.collaborators[].userId);
    }
    
    // Family members within a tree
    match /familyTrees/{treeId}/members/{memberId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/familyTrees/$(treeId)) &&
        (get(/databases/$(database)/documents/familyTrees/$(treeId)).data.createdBy == request.auth.uid ||
         request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/familyTrees/$(treeId)).data.collaborators[].userId);
    }
    
    // Photos, stories, events follow the same pattern
    match /photos/{photoId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /stories/{storyId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /events/{eventId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

    match /photos/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /profiles/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Publish Rules**

   - Try to create a new account
   - Try to sign in with the account

3. **Check Firebase Console**
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - You should see your test user appear

4. **Test Database Connection**
   - Try creating some family tree data in the app
   - Check Firestore Database to see if data appears

## üöÄ Step 9: Optional - Set Up Hosting

If you want to deploy your app to the web:

1. **Install Firebase CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Hosting**
   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```

   - Choose `build` as your public directory
   - Configure as single-page app: Yes
   - Don't overwrite index.html

4. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Firebase: Error (auth/configuration-not-found)"**
   - Check that your Firebase config in `src/firebase/config.ts` is correct
   - Ensure all fields are filled with your actual values (not placeholders)

2. **"Missing or insufficient permissions"**
   - Check your Firestore security rules
   - Make sure you're authenticated when trying to access data

3. **"Storage: User does not have permission"**
   - Check your Storage security rules
   - Ensure the user is authenticated

4. **App won't start after adding Firebase config**
   - Check for syntax errors in `config.ts`
   - Ensure all quotes and commas are correct

### Getting Help:

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Review Firebase documentation: [https://firebase.google.com/docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
- Check the Treehouse GitHub repository for issues

## üéâ You're All Set!

Your Firebase backend is now configured and ready to power your Treehouse family tree application! 

### Next Steps:
- Explore the app features
- Invite family members to join
- Start building your family tree
- Upload photos and share stories

### Security Reminders:
- Never commit your Firebase config with real API keys to public repositories
- Regularly review your Firebase usage and billing
- Update security rules as your app grows
- Enable Firebase App Check for additional security in production
